# Web Application Scalability and Performance Lab

## Aim
The aim of this lab is to ensure that your web application can handle an increasing number of users (scalability), use resources efficiently, and remain secure and reliable. You'll be working with Amazon Web Services (AWS) tools and services to achieve these goals.

## Steps

1. **Understand the Architecture**
   - Your web application is built on a three-tier architecture: 
     1. **Data Tier** (S3 Bucket): Where your data is stored.
     2. **Logic Tier** (EC2 Instances and Load Balancer): Where the application logic processes client requests.
     3. **Presentation Tier**: Where the results are displayed to clients.

2. **Auto Scaling and Load Balancing**
   - **Auto Scaling Group**: A group of EC2 instances that can increase or decrease in number based on demand. This ensures your application can handle more traffic when needed and saves costs when the load is low.
   - **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Distributes incoming traffic across your EC2 instances to ensure no single instance is overloaded and provides a single point of contact for clients.

3. **Simulate Traffic and Monitor Performance**
   - Generate traffic to your web application to test its scalability.
   - Use **Amazon CloudWatch** to monitor the performance of your application, including computing resources and network activity.

4. **Optimize Performance and Costs**
   - Configure your EC2 instances for performance efficiency and cost optimization. This might involve selecting the right instance types, adjusting instance sizes, or using spot instances.

5. **Enhance Security**
   - Adjust the security settings of the load balancer to control incoming traffic. This may include setting up security groups, configuring firewall rules, or using SSL certificates for secure connections.
